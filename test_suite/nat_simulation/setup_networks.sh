Simulates a network setup containing two private networks connected via the public network. Each private network contains two peers using eduP2P
To allow traffic to flow between the public and private networks, the scripts setup_nat_mapping.sh should also be executed
To allow traffic to flow between peers in the same private network, the scripts setup_nat_filtering_hairpinning.sh should also be executed
